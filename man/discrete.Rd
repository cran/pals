\description{
Color palettes designed for discrete, categorical data with a small number of
categories.
}
\details{
The \code{alphabet} palette has 26 distinguishable colors that have logical names
starting with the English alphabet letters A, B, ... Z.
This palette is based on the work by Green-Armytage (2010), but uses the
names 'orange' instead of 'orpiment', and 'magenta' instead of 'mallow'.

The \code{alphabet2} palette uses a similar idea with slightly different colors
and slightly different names.  This palette comes from the Polychrome package,
geenrated with the \code{createPalette} function and then manually
arranged and named.

The \code{cols25} palette was created experimentally by Wright (unpublished)
to create a set of colors that are distinct.

The \code{glasbey} palette by Glasbey et al (2007) has 32 colors that are
maximally distinct. Glasbey has 'white' as the second color, but in this
version of the palette, the color 'white' is moved to the end, and is
actually light-gray, #F2F3F4.

The \code{kelly} palette of 22 colors maximize the contrast
between colors in a set if the colors are chosen in sequential order.
Kelly paid attention to the needs of people with color blindness.  The
first nine colors work well for such people and people with normal vision.
Kelly did not provide RGB color values, and the paper was in black-and-white.
A color image of the Kelly palette can be found in Green-Armytage (2010).
The color 'white' has been re-defined as light-gray, #F2F3F4.
Commentary: We think the kelly palette has an over-abundance of orange-ish
colors, the purples are not very distinct, color 22 (olive green) is almost
identical to color 2 (black), etc.

The \code{polychrome} palette is also from the Polychrome package.
Colors were given a name from the ISCC-NBS standard.

The \code{stepped} palette has 24 colors (5 hues, 4 levels within each hue, plus
4 shades of gray) that is useful for showing varying levels within categories.
Inspired by (http://geog.uoregon.edu/datagraphics/color_scales.htm), but in
order to better separate these colors in RGB space, red hue 0 was moved to hue 350,
green hue 80 moved to hue 90. The number of colors within each hue was reduced
from 5 to 4, and gray shades were added.

The \code{tol} palette has 12 colors by Paul Tol.

The \code{watlington} palette has 16 colors.
The color 'white' has been re-defined as light-gray, #F2F3F4.
